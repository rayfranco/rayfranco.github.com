My personal portfolio is open-source and hosted on github. It is based on [Bourgeon](https://github.com/rayfranco/bourgeon), a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) template I created. You can build this portfolio yourself by cloning the repository and following the build instructions.

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
